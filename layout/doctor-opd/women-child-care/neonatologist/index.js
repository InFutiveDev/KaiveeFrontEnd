      What Does a Neonatologist Do?
    </h2>
    <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
      A Neonatologist is a specialized pediatrician trained to treat newborns, especially premature babies, those with low birth weight, 
      tongue conditions, or complications at birth. Their work involves stabilizing newborns in the delivery room, providing intensive care, and 
      coordinating long-term health support when necessary.
    </p>
    <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
      At Kaivee Healthcare, our Neonatologists lead neonatal resuscitation, developmental monitoring, and family counseling during the earliestâ€”and 
      most crucialâ€”days of life.
