      What Is an Oral & Maxillofacial Surgeon?
    </h2>
    <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
      An Oral & Maxillofacial Surgeon is a dental specialist who has undergone medical level education and training to perform complicated surgical procedures on the oral cavity and surrounding structures. A bridge between dentistry and surgery, these specialists perform anything from trauma repairs to facial realignment operations. They often collaborate with dentists, orthodontists, ENT specialists, and plastic surgeons.

      Your health is on a continuum, and sometimes you need preventive surgery to remain healthy.
