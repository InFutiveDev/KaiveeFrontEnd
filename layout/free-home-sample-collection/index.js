                  In this pandemic, it can be difficult for most people to step
                  out of their homes for blood checkups. And for others, it can
                  be risky. At Kaivee, we understand that health cannot take a
                  backseat even if thereâ€™s a COVID-19 outbreak going on. With
                  the Kaivee home collection service, you have the convenience
                  of getting blood tests at home at an affordable price without
                  compromising on your safety. The home visit service is
                  especially helpful for people having weaker immunity and those
                  who are at a higher risk of facing major complications from
                  COVID-19. So instead of heading outside, having your blood
                  sample collected at home is a safer way to ensure all health
                  needs are fulfilled.
